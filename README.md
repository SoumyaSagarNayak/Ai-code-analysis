## 🔍 About This Project

I built this AI-powered complexity analyzer initially as a personal tool to help me understand code better while practicing on platforms like **LeapCode**. With the integration of **Bolt.NewAI**, this project now smartly analyzes code, detects **time and space complexities**, and offers insightful suggestions for better performance.

It has not only helped **me** in my coding journey, but is also designed to be useful for **others exploring code analysis and Bolt.NewAI**.
